        <h2>What is the Goal of Our Program?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of our program is to find the <strong>best move</strong> in <strong>any given position</strong>
                of the game were playing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                More simply we want to <strong>give</strong> our program a <strong>position</strong> and have it <strong>output</strong>
                the <strong>best move</strong>

        <h2>How Humans Achieve This Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Now when we play board games we share the same goal. To look at the board and find the best move. 
                So lets look at an example of how a humnan might play Tic-Tac-Toe
                <br>
                <br>
                Look at this position in which your playing as X. What is the best move?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Got it.... good. Now unless you've spent countless hours playing against your siblings as a kid
                odds are you had to do a bit thinking to come up with a solution.
                <br>
                <br>
                Quickly looking at the board you probably noticed that there weren't any obvious moves that you could make.
                'O' wasn't threatening you and you couldn't win in one move. So what did you have to do? <strong>Think</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                More specifically you had to think ahead in the game and <strong>weigh the possible moves you could make</strong> with the <strong>responses 'O'
                could make in the future.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                You picked a move in your head, calculated the responses 'O' could make, then calculated the responses you could make to the responses 'O' could make.
                Then you calculated the responses... well you get the idea. 
                <br>
                <br>
                By plotting out the future moves both players could make, you were able to find the best move.

            
        <h2>How our Program is Going to Achieve Its Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Our program is going to the same exact thing we do. It is going to take a position and then compute all the possible future moves and responses that both players
                can make.

        <!-- <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to the first part of this tutorial. In this section I am going to be giving an overview
            and introduction to some of the game-theory, vocabulary and diagrams that I will be doing throughout this tutorial.
            As well as a conceptual overview on how these two player stratey board-game AIs operate.
        </p>

        <h2>How Do Our AIs Make the Best Move?</h2>
        <p>
            The main goals of these programs is to figure out the best move to play
            in any given position on the board. So how do they do that? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Well lets first talk about how humans do this. Sometimes we make moves that just 
            "feel right", having played the game before, our brains have naturally pick up on the patterns and nuances
            that the game provides. Leading us to pick moves almost intuitively and instinctively. 
            <br>   
            <br>
            The second way we pick moves is by thinking things out. We make the move in our head, compute our opponents
            responses and than go from there. If you've ever played chess I'm sure you've had this conversation
            with yourself a million times:
            <br> "Okay if I move the bishop there... then I take, he takes. Than I move here...
            and than he takes.... Okay I can't do that. But if I move the bishop here.... I take, he takes and than I take
            again... Okay I'll do that."
            <br>   
            <br>
            This is what our AI is doing. Were searching through all the possible moves we can make, then looking at the responses our opponent can make to those moves,
            then looking at all the responses we can make to the moves the opponent made, then looking at..... well, you get the idea.
            <br>   
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Game Theory</h2>
        <p>

            Now the reason we are able to look "into the future" of these games is because they are 
            considered perfect information games. This means that both players have access to all the information that the game 
            has to offer. In Chess,Tic-Tac-Toe,Othello... etc. we can see all the pieces on the board --including our opponents-- and we know how each piece moves. Nothing is hidden from 
            the players, there are no surprises. This means that you can predict with 100% certainty the moves players are able to make in any position, because you are perfectly informed
            of the state of the game and know how the pieces move. In the game of poker for example, you have no idea what cards people around the table are holding, you have no idea
            what card is coming in the turn or the river. You in this case are "imperfectly informed".
            <br>
            <br>
            Games like Checkers, Connect Four,Tic-Tac-Toe... etc. are considered two-player sequential games. There are two-players 
            and players take turns making moves sequentially. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The study of these types of games (two-player sequential perfect information games) is called combinatorial game thoery.
