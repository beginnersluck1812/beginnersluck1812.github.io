    <h2>Implementing Alpha Beta Pruning</h2>
    <p>
        Recall that the concept of alpha beta pruning is as follows:
        <br>
        <br>
        The current player <strong>should stop searching</strong> one of its child positions, once it knows its <strong>going to return a worse score</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Now when we implement alpha beta pruning in our search were going to have do it at the child position's child position level.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here's what I mean.
