    <h2>Searching</h2>

   <p>
        In this section of the tutorial I want to talk about <strong>why</strong> we need to search and look ahead in the game
        to find the best move. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To play board games like Chess, Connect Four or Checkers you need to look ahead in the game if you want to be succesful. And its something
        that we all do intuitively and instinctively without giving it a second thought. But have you ever sat down and wondered, why is this the case?
        <br>
        <br>
        I really mean it. Take a sec and wonder why.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thats what I want to talk about: <strong>The Why.</strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now the explanation of <strong>the why</strong> is going to wrinkle your brain,
        its going to apply a buttload of logic, game theory and complexity to something that you take for granted, but trust me, its awesome!
