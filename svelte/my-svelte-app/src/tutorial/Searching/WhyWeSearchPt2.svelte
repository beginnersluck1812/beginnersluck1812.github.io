    <h2>Why We Search</h2>
        <p>
            Using the three principles and laws we estabilished last module, we can now determine why we actually need to search.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong>The best move is the one that puts you in the best position.
            <strong>2.</strong>The best position is the one with the best score.
            <strong>3.</strong>The score of a position is equal to the score of the best position we can move into.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

    <h2>Looking at Our Goal Again</h2>
        <p>
            Remeber that our goal is to find the best move in any given position.
            <br>
            <br>
            Equipped with the above rules, we should be able to do this.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finding the best move really means finding the best position that we can move into (rule number one).
            <br>
            <br>
            The best position is the one with the best score (rule number 2). This means that we need to look at all the positions we can move
            into, find their scores, and then pick the best one.
