    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this section we will be discussing our first algorithm, which is the <strong>NegaMax</strong> algorithm.
        <br>
        <br>
        But before we being looking at it, we first need to identify the goal of our program and AI.
    </p>

<h2>What is the Goal of Our Program?</h2>
   <p>
       The goal of our program is to find the <strong>best move</strong> in <strong>any given position</strong>
       of the game were playing. 
       <br>
       <br>
       More simply we want to <strong>give</strong> our program a <strong>position</strong> and have it find and <strong>return</strong>
       the <strong>best move</strong> that we can make.

 <p class="footnote">**Note that I will be using Tic-Tac-Toe positions in most diagrams rather than Othello positions. Mainly because their easier to make and easier to understand. But remember the concepts are the same between the two</p>
   <h2>NegaMax Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Well, how do we do this... with the <strong>NegaMax</strong> algorithm! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Those of you familiar with the <strong>MiniMax</strong> algorithm will see
        some similarities between the two and ultimately they accomplish the same thing, but <strong>NegaMax</strong> is considered superior due to its simplicity.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>NegaMax</strong> is super important because it is the crux and foundation of our AI. 
        We will never change or get rid of <strong>NegaMax</strong>, we'll only add on to it in order to improve it.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can think of it as the skeleton of our AI. It is crucial to our AI's success and everything that we do in the future is going to develop and revolve around it.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the next section you will begin to learn about the <strong>NegaMax</strong> algorithm, and how it works.
