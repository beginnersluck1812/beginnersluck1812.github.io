        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, in this tutorial we are going to be discussing how you can create and develop your very own two player strategy board game AI
            that can destroy your friends in games like Chess, Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Checkers. Namely I am going to talk about 
            the advanved algorithms and optimizations that are commonly used in the development of these types of AIs. By the end of this tutorial
            you should hopefully have a clear enough understanding of the board-game AI iceberg that you can create a powerful program for yourself.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I'm Creating this Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            The first reason is that I really enjoy this realm of Computer Science and this blog/tutorial gives 
            me a medium to talk about it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And the second reason is feel there is a lack of well documented, 
            thorough and easily understanble tutorials around board game AIs. When I was creating my first
            serious board game AI (a Connect Four AI) the tutorials and papers I found either scratched the surface of the algorithm or 
            were overy complex and esoteric, filled with terms like "Principal Variation", "Lower bound nodes" or "Search windows". 
            I was stuck in a frustating loop of finding tutorials that already covered things I knew and tutorials that 
            covered content that was far beyond my reach of understanding. And I'm not saying that these tutorials were bad in any way, 
            it was just that none of them covered the topics that I wanted to learn about at the level of understanding that I was at.
            <br>
            <br>
            One tutorial that I do want to mention though is <a href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/" target="_blank">Pascal Pons Connect Four Blog</a>. Not only is it (in my opinion) the most
            thorough and well structured tutorial out there, and is a massive influence in this blog, but it's also what got me really into the development of board game AIs, and all
            the knowledge that I have gained couldn't have been possible without my boy Pascal.
        </p>


        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout this tutorial we are going to be following along with the creation of my own Othello AI in C#. 
            We'll start off with a very basic Othello program and build our way up to a much more powerful one.
            Each new version of our program will utilize a new type of algorithm/technique that we will talk and discuss in detail.
            <br>
            <br>
            All the topics that we discuss can be applied to your own programs, but sometimes the execution of certain concepts will differ depending on the game.
            For example the way I determine moves in Othello is going to differ from how you determine moves in Chess or Connect Four. But the concepts we discuss are universal.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, I will be talking about some stuff that strictly relates to the game Othello, and if your not developing your own Othello AI you are more than welcome to skip them.
            <br>
            <br>
            For those who don't know what the game Othello is (few do) here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDnYEOsjZnM" target="_blank">video</a> explaining it.


        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Benchmarks and Testing</h2>
        <p>
           Before we dive into the tutorial I want to discuss the importance of thoroughly testing and benchmarking your AI.
           <br>
           <br>
           Whenever you make a change to your program it can be difficult to determine how it impacted your AI's performance and accuracy as a whole.
           The strength of your AI is dependent on how it performs in wide variety of positions. Testing your AI performance on a few positions
           or playing a couple games against it won't give you an accurate estimation of its performance as a whole.
           
           Meaning if you want to know if your
           AI is improving you need to test it in a wide variety of situations.
           Good tool to see what your AI needs to improve at.
